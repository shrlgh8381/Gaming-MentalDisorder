<b>Instructions to Run Project</b>

1. The Online Gaming Dataset can be <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/online-gaming-anxiety-data'>accessed here</a>
and can be easily downloaded from Kaggle.
2. Need to import these following libraries:
<ul>
<li>DecisionTreeRegressor</li>
<li>DecisionTreeClassifier</li>
<li>sklearn.metrics</li>
<li>sklearn.model_selection</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>matplotlib.pyplot</li>
<li>seaborn</li>
</ul>
3. In order to run our project, run the machine_learning.py module alongside the
data_visualizations.py module to get the predictions and the graphs. After
running the data_visualizations.py module, 9 graphs should be generated as png
files as follows:
<ul>
<li>age_gaming.png</li>
<li>excessivegamingnarcissism.png</li>
<li>Generalized Anxiety Disorder.png</li>
<li>hours_over_20.png</li>

<b>Research Questions</b>

1. What degree of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) does gaming have on work for
people who play online games for more than 20 hours a week?
2. How does being a student at college/university or being an individual who is
unemployed/between jobs affect the hours of online games an individual plays?
3. How likely is it that individuals who game more than 20 hours a week score a 4 or 5 on
the narcissism scale?

<b>Information on the Dataset</b>

The dataset we are using contains information collected about online gaming anxiety,
specifically gaming in association to GAD, satisfaction with life and social phobia. This dataset
can be <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/online-gaming-anxiety-data'>accessed here</a>. The columns of the Online Gaming Anxiety dataset correlate with each survey question on a
questionnaire that was part of a psychological study.

While the dataset includes general identifying information such as gender, age and
employment status, it also encompasses questions about what game a person plays, gaming
platforms, the amount of time spent gaming weekly, whether there are any earnings or streaming
for the games, and the reasons an individual plays the game. These are all categories that factor
into anxiety, satisfaction with life, social phobia and even narcissistic tendencies and behaviors. The psychological study therefore also asked and received informative answers on questions involving the gaming individualâ€™s level of anxiety, satisfaction with life and degree of social phobia.
